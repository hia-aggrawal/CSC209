NAME
	addecho - Add echo to a sound. Takes in existing wav files and in return creates a new wav file that has echo in the sound.

SYNOPSIS
		
	addecho [-d delay] [-v volume_scale] sourcewav destwav

DESCRIPTION

	The addecho function adds echo to the original sound file(WAV file) by creating a new file with echo added in the file.
		
	The following option is available:

	-d delay
		It is the number of samples after which the audio echos in the output file. If the number of sample is not specified then, the default value: 8000 will be used to create an output. -d delay makes the delay start after xxxx seconds in the output audio. The default rate of sampling is 22050, hence, the sample
		is divided by sampling rate to calculate the delay. 
		
	-v volume_scale
		It is the volume of the wav sound file in the output file. In case it is not mentioned, a default value of 4 will be taken into consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                              

	-sourcewav
		The path to original source mono sound WAV file on which echo has to be added.

	-destwav
	 	The path where the echoed sound WAV file will be outputted.


RETURN VALUES
		
	The addecho()function returns values that include outputting a mono WAV file.


EXAMPLES
	addecho -d 12000 -v 4 door.wav door_12000_4.wav
		Add echo to the sound file with a delay of 12000 samples and scale volume by 4, starting with the original door.wav.
	
	addecho -d 3000 -v 2 door.wav door_3000_2.wav
		Add echo to the sound file with a delay of 3000 samples and scale it by 2, starting with the original door.wav.

	addecho -d 60000 -v 0.5 door.wav door_60000_0.5.wav
		Add echo to the sound file with a delay of 60000 samples and scale it by 0.5, starting with the original door.wav.
	
	addecho -d 2000 -v 1 door.wav door_2000_1.wav
		Add echo to the sound file with a delay of 2000 samples and scale it by 1, starting with the original door.wav.
	
WARNINGS

	Invalid Delay Key
		Delay value must be greater than 0.
		
	Invalid Volume Scale
		Volume scale value must be greater than 0.
